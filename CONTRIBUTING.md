# Contributing to minigrep

Thanks for your interest in this learning project. Contributions that clarify code, improve docs, or add small features are appreciated.

## Development Setup
- Install Rust (stable) and Cargo.
- Build: `cargo build`
- Run: `cargo run -- <query> <file>`
- Lint/Format: `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` and `cargo fmt --all`
- Test: `cargo test` (use `-- --nocapture` to see output when debugging)

## Coding Guidelines
- Rust 2024 edition, 4-space indentation.
- Keep `main` minimal; prefer logic in `src/lib.rs` as code grows.
- Use `Result<T, E>` and `?` instead of panicking on user-controlled I/O.
- Validate and document CLI arguments clearly.

## Tests
- Unit tests live next to code under `#[cfg(test)]` in `src/*.rs`.
- Integration tests go in `tests/` with fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`.
- Prefer behavior-oriented names, e.g., `search_finds_substring`.

## Commit and PR Guidelines
- Commits: short, imperative subject (â‰¤72 chars) with focused changes.
- Include reasoning in the body when nontrivial.
- If commits are generated by codex-cli, append `[codex-cli]` to the subject.
- PRs: include description, reproduction steps, expected vs actual output, and CLI examples.
- Link related issues; attach sample input/output when helpful.

## Security & I/O
- Treat file paths as untrusted; handle missing/permission errors gracefully.
- Avoid unchecked `expect` on user I/O.

## Documentation
- Keep README up to date with current behavior.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with notable changes and commit references.

Happy hacking!
